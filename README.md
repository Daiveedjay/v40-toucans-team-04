Hi team. Donn from team 4 here. I've just cloned the repo and am starting to push commits to our repo. For the design we are going to use Figma for wireframes. You can download it at https://www.figma.com/

Once downloaded, we can collaborate on the design work in Figma and use github for sharing our html, css & js files. 

Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point - 
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.

> Own it & Make it your Own!
